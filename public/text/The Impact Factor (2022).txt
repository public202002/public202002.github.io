life's a penny walk you don't have any particular place to go so you just walk
each time you get to a corner you flip a penny heads go right
tails go left you never know where you're lit up

just a series of choices each choice made it against it
you never know how big an impact your choices make
city hall is only four miles from fair hill and you've never been here
one class of temples mountain tasting north philly we got more cold boxes in temple than

i want to thank you for coming and sharing this unprecedented vision
for our city the city of brotherly love not to mention your donations of course
so in conclusion my friends i have three words for you
integrity honor impact
yes 3 p.m big ones so between us girls

how are you handling the super-sized libido what's it like in the frying pan
on the record the mayor is the only person in this race who can really make an impact
off the record nobody really gives a damn about his sex life
250 people we have 10 minutes to move in america you want to count on my support and we both know that you need to
kill me [Music]
i'll talk to the mayor personally councilman you're gonna see those permanently
vanish

judge carter i'm just not sure this holds up it's not a choice alistair nothing about justice is black and white
to get control you got to take it listen it's simple the mayor is bad you cut out
the bad before it rides the good whatever it takes but it's just not the way i thought that we stopped thinking
that's the job
[Music]

you make one choice differently and absolutely nothing nothing is the same
[Music]
[Music]
hmm [Music]

supposedly it was old ben who coined the phrase a penny saved is a penny earned
but in view of a curious tradition involving franklin's grave there are
those who would counter that sage advice with a penny tossed is a penny lost
seventy five dollars worth of pennies are tossed on the grave each and every week comes down to about a thousand
pennies or so each day now that doesn't sound like a lot right until you realize that's 390 000 pennies each year and if
you really want to get fun with the math it's about 45 pennies per hour day in day out

and on your right you'll see a 9 foot bronze bust of benjamin franklin the artist james peniston visited 24 nearby
elementary schools to speak with the students he asked them to bring old keys from home well they responded by
delivering over 1 000 keys buckets of them the keys were then cast into the
sculpture leading a generation of philly kids to be able to point to that sculpture and say i helped make that
it's not okay last semester i didn't see you at all this semester only once and

that was for lunch and your mother's not telling me a damn thing not my fault
maybe it's better this way i mean we aren't exactly close
why do you suddenly care why do i suddenly care i shelled out 40 grand this year alone
for your education and i'm not the one living in society hill maybe it would help if you actually
thought i was worth it or maybe it would help if you actually liked me liked you liked me listen i

ain't gotta like you for the last 20 years did you have clothes on your back
for the last 20 years did you starve did you get your education
you think your big checkbook in the sky paid for that like you
i didn't ask for you i came to an agreement with your mother
and i took responsibility for you i ain't got to like
[Music]

oh
well here's to what could have been in the pile of that has become
damn
and with close to 700 rooms city hall is still the largest municipal building in
north america and maybe the world the statue of penn stands 37 feet tall and
weighs 27 tons he is the tallest sculpture on top of any building in the world for years a gentleman's agreement
stated that the philadelphia art commission would approve no building in the city which would rise above this
statue but you know how gentlemen are which explains the curse of billy penn

and the failure of philly's major professional sports teams to win championships since the march 1987
construction of the one liberty place skyscraper
diego you know i don't see you standing on this corner hawking that crap
[Music]

i mean split down the middle it's not good it's not evil
okay so the black the black is the unknown and then the white
that brings the true spirits up nice
supposed to be powerful not nice it's you
split down the middle powerful

yeah like i said it's it's not good and it's not evil you went hard
i'm hard enough to make it stick you gotta be what are you going to do with this
making me a mask so i don't disappear it could make me into something
significant significant yeah you know like somebody cares about
you like they'd give a if you died no one cares about me right now but
but they're gonna see me put my game face on do you think i can make a ruckus
do you think we'll ever get out of here no no i don't i don't think there's any
place but here for people like us you mean something to me
yeah yeah it's mutual

your grandma got a death wish no it's not the first time she's always sticking her nose in it
come on let's go
pet steaks or genos you know i've come to the conclusion of what makes a philly cheese steak taste
better than anywhere else it's the argument do we need to just don't practice your spanish at
gino's when you order you might get cheese whiz on bread
[Music]

where's your mom [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
i know i don't have time but andy sheppard taught me to it we can leverage the community's service
angle you know top ranking member of the mayor's staff mentors at-risk girls through the
celebration of remarkable women program make sure you get something out on this lloyd
hard to believe it's been four years time flies when you're working your ass off
excuse me impacting the lives of the people of philadelphia so where do you stand

onto sam robert's issue i like my chances activating sam robbins for the mayor
would be quite a coup your work is all very impressive thank you you'll be the youngest chief
of staff the mayor has ever had there's a reason i haven't taken a weekend off in four years

i want this bad so does
todd's been productive for a long time he's a quality political aide he is a quality political aide
but i've been more productive and i agree with you he is a quality aide
you'll be the first woman gentlemen my father was a councilman and while he wasn't always attentive the one thing he
did give me was experience i did a lot of campaign stops i grew up around men who drank sore
farted and twisted arms trust me i can handle it

let us bring it to the selection committee then we'll talk great i'm on my way
inquire states that american values spent 5.4 million on williams campaign so far this year
i mean that's more than all the mayoral candidates combined so what are you gonna do about it can't outspend
american values there's only three months left and i can't raise that kind of money what'd
your dad have done build collaborations and control the conversation which brings us back to sam robbins
and keeping the conversation off of the mayor's sex life how are you holding up

i'm always grateful yeah so you say still trying to beat your dad's record by the time you hit middle age
you do know it took him 60 plus years and he lost his bid for mayor
not to mention the fact that running for mayor eventually killed him but he made a difference lloyd
his life meant something even if you do nothing you make an impact

imagine the mother does nothing with her kid what's the impact on that kid okay i
get it mothers need to pay attention to their kids luckily i'm not a mom
but i'm not so sure the small stuff really matters that much
the devil's in the details and i'm focused on doing something big
small stuff matters think about it the mother impacts the kid

but not only that kid she impacts every person that kid comes into contact with and you're supposed to
ease my mind less pressure right i'm not trying to put the weight of the world on you
luckily you and i aren't the only two people in the world there's 9 billion other folks in the equation
yeah everyone has to choose what to do about it it's your choice and it's your choice bigger than any choice you've
ever imagined and i think you have an appointment oh yes i do

small actions one step at a time thanks lloyd [Music]
crap you're supposed to save me who invited your superior ass to fairfield anyway
uh your probation officer maybe something about taking a brick to a girl's head
[Music] cut the language and have some respect or we can pay or visit together

that's better
we're not so different after all jayla my dad's gone too the only difference is
he's been dead for two years right okay i get it you were the perfect
daughter with the perfect mother and the perfect job working for the perfect mayor

and now you have the perfect dead dad my dad wasn't perfect jayla
but when i think about him i think about those little idiosyncrasies that only i know about
the fact that he took loaves of bread to rhonda jackson's down on 5th street every week
he was always there lying to mr baker telling him he looks better than the day before i'll show you perfect
[Music]

you're not perfect jayla and your dad isn't perfect either he's gone
so the question is what are you gonna do about it [Music] i have fault okay
but you have a perfectly clear choice you can live a life far beyond fair hill

but the only way you're finding out what kind of life you have is by taking a shot [Music]
swoosh so trashing well i'm not going to prosecute a woman who is the sole support of a boy down to castle
but if he dies well that's another story okay
another story for you armstrong often bends and sometimes

breaks troubles to get convictions finds tenuous rationales for charging defendants with crimes when the original
charges fail to stick and charges innocent people to frighten them into testifying against others
so they say armstrong has been found in contempt of court 10 times for such behavior and his
tactics occasionally incur negative publicity for the da's office oh yeah well let's see how that breaks

this year but armstrong exhibits a sincere desire to see justice done to that an armstrong
has gone after defendants accused of perverting the justice system to arrange wrongful convictions with just as much
determination as his more mundane cases what can i say i'm a knight and shining armor
such aggressive actions in the courts have earned him the nickname hang him armstrong he has developed a reputation with both
colleagues and rival attorneys once being referred to as the top of the legal food chain by rival attorney
during a trial hang him high armstrong
swoosh

perfect you're an idiot you see the garbage getting into the rug do you want me to fix this yeah like you fix
everything what does that mean you screw up everything you do what's your problem anyway aren't you
supposed to be thrilled at the thought of being dick tracy what's wrong feeling sorry for yourself again look it's not
dick tracy okay and i'm tired are you try handling my job
perez isn't exactly textbook don't worry i'm sure you'll screw this up like everything else it's the can't stand you
try to please everyone you get screwed and then who's left to deal with it i pay the price always
i swear [Music]

can you just please get the waiter over here
i just want to see where this goes todd so do i
so then step on can we at least agree on being exclusive
let's see what happens just see where it leads us
destiny [Music] i don't mean to be pushy

but we're perfect together we're friends with lawyers we both work for the mayor
pretty soon you're gonna be working for me on paper it makes perfect sense i mean
it's a no-brainer sorry traffic on kensington was impossible be right there
you know what lewis is here i'll be right back
[Music]

good how are things we'll see y'all great okay complete yeah everything's
going really good what's next for you cheaper stiff yeah yeah
good luck with that
yes
yes maybe
alistair i talked to the guy at the justice center i know you've been dropping cases
i get it you don't want to talk
i'm not ticked look ouster i'm not asking if the pd is
lying i know they are i just want to know who's behind this

you might want to put your mark on this you work with me and i'll work with you
so you think armstrong has something maybe
i just don't know if this is for us it feels thin
so what are you working on now well sam robbins has
something on the mayor and angela bean doesn't that sex and politician story

get old with you barry that said it's my only sex life since
i've got here so it makes it quite easy to figure out why sex in the workplace is so popular
power sex what's not to like which explains why you're eating alone again right
gotta love this job so single girl in the big city what's in the kitchen
my favorite
you
[Music]

hmm
[Music] uh
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
you're the oldest taylor girl ain't you yes ma'am seen you with my jayla yes ma'am
don't imagine she saw me she don't look at me no more
i think sam ron wasn't the key to the ball trying to kill me no todd carrington is
trying to kill you he always goes a step too far destiny the mayor wants results lloyd and if we
don't seize the initiative on this you know todd will i'm not gonna stand around while todd
claims the cheapest stop slot i thought you were pretty tight with todd complicated
look lloyd i want to shake up philadelphia and i can't do that without making things happen
you have to have power to make a difference and the mayor needs all the power we can muster for him
what else can we do to make sure we tap into sam i want to create a big impact here lloyd
small actions produce big results destiny good or bad you better start thinking about what kind of impact you
want to have i need a big impact here
you need a positive impact or it's not worth anything at all the politics is selling right
at one level i guess well all of sales is based on trust and
value if you don't trust me you shouldn't do visit with me if you do trust me then all i need to do is create
some real value i get the trust issues floyd i'm not sure how you get past demayo's
trust ratings but you better put some real value in the equation well the mayor is valuable
so how do i sell that to the city i'm talking real value here
like if i talked you out of a dollar but gave you back two dollars i'll go for that and if i asked you for
another dollar if i trusted you i'd go for that and if i kept giving you two dollars for every
dollar that keep going for as long as you kept delivering i think somebody might notice
maybe and if i did the same thing for them maybe the word would get out
do you think i need help selling that service social media the papers paid advertising okay
i think i get the point the mayor has talked a heck of a lot of people out of a lot of dollars we need to start
thinking about how to get some of those dollars back here i'll chip in
i can start with my two cents bam one little pebble and it starts that little scratch nobody's gonna see that
it's just a little scratch now but you give it a few months the paint's gone the rust starts to collect
pretty soon you have a six inch hole in the side of this classic but we do this now a little putty
sand a little a little paint and we're back to perfection
[Music] it's no little thing destin it's not often someone from the mayor's office personally takes on a mentoring
project and jayla is a real challenge
that's exactly what her probation officer said but i like challenges oh you do good
how did the uh basketball go well i managed to survive the first
session what's the rest of the story with jayla
dad's out of the picture mom's got serious drug problems i don't even think she comes around much
she is currently living with her grandmother in fair hill
a tough kid she's mad at everyone
she was bullied her entire life and got tired of it be careful with this one destiny
smart andy i'm just saying be careful she's a manipulator and she wants it her
way and if she wants it she's going after it
why are you right next to me because you're the first volunteer that i've ever been attracted to
thank god don't think of me as a volunteer i'm a lawyer
normally a deal breaker but i'm all about expanding my level of tolerance
self improvement etc impressive
thank you
i feel guilty every time i do that spider's got to have a perspective on life right
i mean it's moving along going to a place minding its own business and then bam
it's a greasy spot personally i don't want any spider in my space
no matter what its perspective is okay
i'm impressed it's a gutsy call on the judge carter story that's one way of putting it
or foolishness it's another i think alistair armstrong is going to a brick
you know mike is trying to sue for the sealed docks in the mallards case he's
going to sue the city you think he has a chance depends on the judge
about armstrong yeah okay
mike wants to talk to us us
us we try but there's really not much we can do
it takes somebody to die before these lots get cleaned up that's what happens in neighborhoods
like this we found hundreds of needles inside here
they have to keep the mask on what y'all doing
where we gonna do our needles at now where we gonna get high
mayor that's sam roberts ward he's not budging
where can we squeeze in most his development project kensington is the main route to that
shopping district keep that jammed up the businesses in the area are going to be screaming at them
if nothing's moving those businesses are going to be dying isn't that going to come back on you mayor what if someone
figures out you're the one throwing the monkey range into this and who's going to tell them
that's sam robin's project not our fault if the contracts just can't get anything right
ever since they caught the strangle way down in the open the cops are cool with it all the hustle and bustles because
kensington is becoming drunk past freezing a drug bust frieza yeah back
when they were on the hump the strangler cops flooded this place but after they called ramirez they just
retreated cost money have cops on the street like that city ain't got it that's good to know all right thanks
hey please
i know she's going to want to talk to me i'll be right with you councilman robin
i could take care of this for you know
all right sam robin's brand project to revitalize the shopping kensington shopping district
has come to a standstill along with all the traffic the contractor's problems played the
project for the second straight month i like
it looks like como's found himself a fine woman young and tasty
i'd love to get up in that right there boy the perez that's a kid
yo lady black rookie personally i like white meat
you're up perez you know that you're up
hey hey hey hey is this your squeeze thomas what are you
doing what the hell are you doing
don't shoot him officer please don't shoot don't shoot me please though please
don't shoot off [Laughter] please don't shoot hey
thanks for the squeeze babe come on you keep that one safe for me all right
you got the power girl so you got the power huh that's the thing about power you never
quite get enough that's because you want control what are the odds of anyone being in control of
anything these days i need control okay chief if you want control the first thing you need to do
is get control of todd it's past time that todd gets brought back in line he's going too far in the sam robbins
thing we're almost there lloyd sam's caving and we need to finish this off now
i'm brand new at this chief of staff thing the selective committee made it emphatically clear that i need to make
sure sam robbins support gets locked in and in the meantime i need to be careful who i step on
we've got time just be patient and we'll make this right todd needs to be handled
bottom line better off planting seeds and trying to control weeds rather than just hack weeds like todd
out right now in my humble but accurate opinion well first i want to congratulate you on
your new position the city's new interim district attorney you're in charge of the drug prosecutions
is it accurate to say that the city is going to continue to look
the other way in regards to the heroin users well first of all there is no hands-free
zone in the city of philadelphia and it never will be commissioner hogan does not support it and no one in this
department does now you're out there talking to junkies with a couple ounces of drugs in them who can't be trusted to
make a loser state the philadelphia police department is doing the best it can to guarantee public safety and stop
drug use with the resources it has but they can't lock up people without good reason look junkies got rights too
i can't just prosecute someone for hanging out on the stoop looking like they're high on drugs now that's what's accurate
that's the word from the interim district attorney aleister armstrong
in regards to the hand-free zone in the badlands of philadelphia
all right until next time aleister thanks for your statement
i heard you had something for me yeah i sure do sam robbins is setting up seven
community meetings now the goal is to get input from 75 to 100 people in different areas of the city who will
help inform some more policy-based combat against the drug crisis
that's supposed to change something yep more talking and if drugs is going to be the
conversation judge carter wants me in the middle of it i mean he's been up my ass again about raising the bar in fair hail in
kensington he wants a full docking on his bench then you get to be the driving force of
justice huh you're a big fan of justice perez right
but uh no you get to be the drivers force behind justice i get to take the credit
did you just be more than happy to take care of you as long as you give what he wants so make some noise
take the ball around yeah okay
what's going on with your mom we'd all be better off without moms
i don't know she used to be good she had five kids but she was always singing and dancing
she would cuddle with me and it smelled good when she was singing you know you felt
good all over now
not so good now
now she's out to die i gotta go [Music]
how are you hey how are you is that it
we're not dealing with you right now give it to me right now give it to me right now how this works do you wait in the background where is my mouth give me
my money give me your calm down do not move give me my match right now sir relax
we don't need to do this i want right now keep my legs
[Music]
[Music] i need more paper
get those streets moving boy it's a little late for that destiny let's make it happen find out exactly what time
[Music]
[Music] what's taking so long
destiny drifting has been implicated in the political strong-arming of sam robbins miss drifting is accused of
deliberately tying up streets in robin's ward which caused the death of eight-year-old amanda rawlings
[Music]
one step at a time amanda rawlings is gone but your life isn't over by a long shot nobody cares
about my life lloyd you tell me how is my life supposed to make any difference after this from
everything i know about you you're still your dad's daughter destiny he didn't exactly hold it together when
things got tough floyd you will and you know what i meant he did some pretty significant things
and you can learn from what he didn't do so well not doing so good so far am i
you'll be fine i'm going to set you up with mikayla jackson she knows how to handle the crisis
michaela jackson are we talking about the same person she hasn't had any real influence since
she was mayor and that's been like a decade and a half ago she's been silent for years is she even
alive michaela jackson is about as live as you can get and she knows about making things happen talk to her
destiny drifting is going to prison if i have any say in it and that goes double for the mayor too i mean this administration chose to put politics
over people and amanda rollins paid for well now it's time for a man to get the justice she's over period they're saying
that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time what do you believe mayor yo mayor thank you thank you very much
hey what about actually todd carrington may have done some things i don't know about but sam
robbins is way off base accusing me of sexual harassment with angela b you haven't had a peep out of her have
you i have not had contact with that woman that wasn't entirely professional
not quite what you expected i'm a long way from the splendor and power of city hall
i wasn't thinking anything like that i'm just not sure why lloyd was so insistent we
meet well from what i can see you've got a few things closing in on you
maybe he thought i'd just be a good listener i've had a few things close in on me on my time
look no offense but uh i've got more than a few things closing
in on me and i don't have a lot of time to spend sitting around talking about it my life is ticking down by the second
and in about 10 minutes i'll be down to worthless
well i can tell you one thing in about two seconds if you feel like your life is falling
apart and you feel worthless maybe it's about time you started thinking about someone besides yourself
honestly i'm more worried about the mayor than i am about myself i think he's falling apart what makes
you say that you can't imagine in your wildest dreams that the mayor would ever give up
on the surface he's the same he's working hard as ever putting on a good face doing what needs to be done
but he's not really there he's going through the motions you look
at him and think none of this stuff is affecting him at all but i know it's killing him
he reminds me of my dad when things started going bad for him you mean the campaign financing thing
what did your dad do when things started closing in drink and what did he do when things
were going well just little things one step at a time
but he knew he was making a difference seems like that worked better
right up until it did
the way i see it you don't have no choice like she got you by the balls for me man
so what you gonna do about it it's not like that and she got a reason to be angry
she ain't exactly get what she was expecting when she married what the hell was she expecting
when we were dating she thought i was god god
i was at the bar pretty high didn't god knows i was only trying to get through the day
well you made it a lot longer than i thought you would
so how about you you were married at some point well she expected
nothing then one day she decided to raise the bar
she got something that's for damn sure
sorry so what'd you get out of that
i got a lot of bills my daughter thinks of a pile of
tell me why you still in this slugging it out just crept up on me
one day i decided to stick with her maybe it changes tomorrow but
can't beat up on her for a choice that i made
she can't change and i know it so it's my choice to make
can't blame her for being hurt today i chose to stay
it's my choice i hate it i love it
yeah you didn't know you love this stuff
hey what can i say here's the hunt big bad hunter goes off and kills himself advanced
order bears no band i mean he knows exactly what he's doing and he's been doing it for years don't think i don't
see the car and you have them in your sights doesn't it bother you and the guys got
away from kids right everything about what this does to them well there's a greater good thing going on here like it
doesn't matter the ends justify the means i'm not trying to hurt anybody but you are right
collateral damage human damage yep [Music]
but it's not the same as any
man who did the same and then put
[Music]
[Music] oh
might be like me and have no need
[Music]
[Music] myself
[Music]
and not so wise [Music]
until i died [Music]
someday [Music]
i'll be there [Music]
it's hard to imagine how fast everything has just collapsed my political life gone my job
gone mayor gone reputation gone and finances soon to be gone
and if the d.a decides he can stick some charges i could be living in a whole other world
i have zero clue what i'm supposed to be doing that's where you start
and then you just take one step at a time like to ask people two questions
the first question is what do you like to do when you get up in the morning
what do you mean some people get up and they talk on the phone all day
some people want to go out in the sunshine and create a garden
some people like to get up on a stage and speak to thousands of others
other people would hate doing that what is it that you like to do when you
get up in the morning what's the one thing that would make you so eager that you would stay up all
night in anticipation for the sheer joy of doing it
i just want to have a real impact i watched my dad when he was a councilman impacting lives every day
he was always there pulling strings for the people who didn't have any power or influence and
you think you can't do that i think my string flowing days were over
the day commander all of my impact has been
a negative calling
so uh what was the second question
when you get to the end of your life what will you have done to make you feel like you lived you loved and you made a
difference i figured if you start every day eager to get going
and then you get to the end of your life and you feel like you've lived you've loved and you've made a difference
that's a pretty good life it could have been
just bringing the book back mr robbins so what did you think
sad story but lots of history in this place nothing's changed has it
everything not much i like the part where gabriel was drawing pictures of the kids dying one
by one at fair hill you know i always thought someone should do something like that for auto
accidents just like take a bucket of red paint and toss it on the pavement where someone died
the streets may be covered with blood i'd rather want to see the streets covered in hope
someone should make that happen
what the hell are you doing you want to be a traffic cop or something i can arrange that
somebody got to die before we start deciding to do something listen that's your choice man
you can go back tomorrow damn
maybe they'll give you a gold medal be a meter maid or something
driving like you crazy
so [Music]
[Music] [Applause]
time to do some squeezing pull them
[Music]
over oh [Music]
come out i'm out of the car you turn the vehicle off please step out
thank you go back to that vehicle hold me this way
guys can i see your hands on the car
[Music]
not very good at housekeeping i
i think i found something ah
it's yours no was in your car no it's not mine
is it yours is that on your nose no way caress i
ain't stupid i think we have to take them down
cuff him you gonna need a lawyer
i thought we had something jayla you think i did this i didn't do do you think i'm stupid
i would be on probation and just carry this around como doesn't even do snow
which is why they found a kilo of coke in his car right you know believe me or not but i'm
screwed either way and what about care okay you clearly don't care
all i know is that the judge said that i had to bring 5k where they're hauling my ass off to state prison
and they rape girls like me there
any vulnerability she senses she'll exploit she's hurting andy
and who she got her grandmother was her only rock and como and brianna are the only friends she has as far as i can
tell i'm just saying be careful
she's as smart as a weapon she's not afraid to use it she knows what she wants
and what she wants is out she's gonna use any trick in the book to
make that happen sounds just like me up until three months ago
right now i went up too
hey hey i know you they're gonna fry you lady
well i know you too diego and you have no idea how cold it can get in this part of
philly you know i still have a few friends in this neighborhood maybe
i should give abel parson a call what you want from me
i don't got nothing to do with the that happened in jail yeah well what about your friend
coma come on i'm not saying about coma
hey
[Music]
um
i know como
yeah he ain't stupid what do you mean stupid
diego do snow como stays clear he ain't stupid
well maybe you just don't see it well i'm not stupid
i just want to disappear
you did that didn't you why'd you drop out of sight what makes you think i'm out of sight
i haven't heard one thing about you in 10 years you were on top you were everywhere
and then you just vanished sometimes it doesn't matter whether anyone sees you or not
especially when you don't care who takes the credit okay keep your secrets
most people have plenty of them well that's true what about you what are you keeping quiet about these days jayla williams
what about her she's back in jail again a kilo a coke in the car and she's telling me the judge is going to send
her to state prison unless she comes up with five grand in cash and you believe that
she says she needs someone to take cash to the courthouse the courthouse and you're going to do this i've got
about 10 grand in my bank account no jobs prospects an interim da sniffing
around and the stink of killing a kid on my resume you think i need trouble mr green this
is a preliminary arraignment i'm going to read a set of chargement laws against you you have the right to remain silent any things you now say may and will be
used against you in this court or any other court of law you have a right to an attorney prior to making any
statements or answering any questions and if you cannot afford an attorney you want to be appointed for you free of charge from the public defender's office
you have the right to a preliminary hearing you have the right to waive that preliminary hearing now you've been charged by
detective antonia perez with the following crimes which include an alleged violation of
title 35 section 780-113 subsection 30 which is possession of drugs with the intent to deliver
also subsection 16 possession of drugs and subsection 32 possession of drug
paraphernalia i am not asking whether you agree with these charges just that i'm informing you of them i have some
paperwork for you to sign well you've got some papers assigned now
okay armstrong puts more fair hill drug dealers behind bars keep them coming
alistair oh you know i will since you were appointed interim you've got a double-digit lead according to the
inquirer but i won a nest egg for your campaign fund for the district attorney race argument with that
and you've got to keep control of the conversation keep perez on the prowl
why are we having this conversation you know this isn't right alistair
it's your duty to look into this let me get this right
do you want to get involved with jayla williams are you suicidal jayla williams has been nothing but
trouble ever since she was eight years old i mean don't you have something more important to worry about
did it ever occur to you that i'm going through every book you've ever made in the mayor's office so i
guarantee if you don't have enough to keep you busy and out of trouble now
i can add to the power i keep your nose clean as a whistle if i
was you because i'm watching everything you do that has attention
not expecting to see you two in my neighborhood you're a good man sam we can use someone decent decent
what kind of decision have you seen what do you know about the decency of alice well as far as i know he hasn't killed
any kids recently no one wanted amanda to die sam no lord it's just politics right
are you two out trying to dig up some dirt on armstrong just looking for the truth there's something going on in judge
cardon court and armstrong doesn't seem to be too interested in checking into it
i always thought that armstrong was big on justice a little too zealous in fact
i know that carter and the governor wanted the maragon and armstrong while he's always looking for a bigger hat
he's pushing for that d.a slot gives him something that he can bet his future on
but maybe he just doesn't like you at least that's what the papers say what about judge carter
i'm not a fan
damn
what is she supposed to be paying a judge cash for and clearly our interim d.a doesn't want
to touch this as much as he loves publicity you'd think he'd be all over this
maybe he's got his attention focused a little bit on you so you think i should just drop it
i think you have enough problems already i think you don't need any more trouble
i think jayla gets herself into messes like this and i think that interim d.a is trying
to put the final nail in your coffin i think
jayla might be the best
so let me get this right the judge is extorting you and you want me to pay her five grand
i've never seen 5k in my life my dad doesn't give a and my mom doesn't know what day it is
brianna and komo are the only people i have in my life and i mean komo's about to go off to fayette for a long time
now all i got is you and you're just some washed up do-gooder
with all the you're going through your money's not going to mean anything soon meals are free here
might as well make use of it that's the way you feel about me
it's just how i feel about life you know don't don't worry about it okay
no one else does and it's easy to care when things are going well but i mean with all the you're going through
it's not fair what they're doing to you it makes sense you don't have time to
worry about my so you think this is just gonna go away
if i deliver the money that's what the man said
i know it's not right and no i haven't figured it out
i don't have a clue
so
okay you're free to go
[Music] so it's gonna happen
it already did it always amazes me how these things work amazing one tiny thing one detail and
everything changes for better or for worse richer
home and jail are out just like that how apparently judge carter threw out
the traffic stop and all this just goes away well i'm not sure it's completely gone but i do know
come and jail are back on the streets i'm gonna have jayla camp out at my
place until she gets back on her feet she's looking for a part-time job and i'm trying to give her some space to
create something new it's going to be a bit tricky i think but let me see if i can help
you've done a lot for her andy i think she has a bit of a crush on you
what about you do you have enough crush on me to grab id
all right so it doesn't make calls anymore but it still takes pictures and videos and the games still work
she just give you the new one yeah i don't know she said i need to be able to get callbacks from the
applications stepping up from fair hill are you i am stepping up from jail and
i'm just glad to be out
sounds like judge carter wanted them out to me i mean why would just carter want them out the criminal
deserves to be punished and deserves to be punished and proportioned to the gravity of their crimes i mean that's justice
who gets to decide that alistar well looks like that's my job i mean somebody's got to do it how do you make
that choice aleister flip a coin i don't know she's really starting to get together
michaela it's not gonna happen overnight but she's changed since she's living with me
it's like she held on just enough hope to keep herself alive and now it's starting to peek through the
she's always lived in just one step at a time that's my motto
you keep water in that plant it's going to grow but my real question is how are you
doing like you said one step at a time and just keep walking
well in my case crawling i've got good people in my life and i
appreciate that but it's not putting rent money in my pocket most employers aren't looking for
lawyers on the bottom is that how you feel like you're on the bottom i messed up
maybe i didn't see it coming maybe i didn't pull the trigger but
amanda rowling's paid the price now i'm the one who's paying for it
and let me be clear i deserve to pay for this it's an interesting word
deserve you need to break that word into two parts and start focusing on the second
half
thank you thank you hey we've been here a while huh yeah
well i opened his house with a day closing so have a good night yeah you too thank you
so
so
foreign
what did they do to her nothing yet just threatening to throw her back in
jail if she doesn't come over another five thousand dollars oh but it gets worse another one of my kids out of probation
is telling the same kind of story only for her it's 10k this street says they're going after
kids that are in trouble and squeezing them to go to the people that care about them to raise the money so they give them a little hope
and they squeeze them for more how can they get away with that how can they not it's the judge in the interim
d.a who are these kids going to complain to their probation officer i think it's the same probation officer oh god help
them i think god already did you see the three of us in this room
right this is not gonna go unanswered you know that they will go after you with everything that they've got and
they've got a lot destiny you know how i feel about you and i really just don't want to see you here anymore
i mean you've been through a living hell the last few months and you've already got more than you could deal with
if you call this hell you haven't seen me ticked off yet well my dear friends i just got mad
in fact like howard beal said i'm mad as hell and i'm not gonna take it anymore
let's crush these bastards well let the fun and games begin
put your hands on the pole put them up they're up
slowly
you know the slowly
oh it's been a while since you've been down here with your dad two years since he died a good man
yeah he was you still making ugly things pretty this golden knee's all wrecked you know
you always know how to find it plenty of ugly to go around too
coma said you've been seeing some i told the d.a something's going on but nothing's happening
i'm going back down here tomorrow
[Music]
get out of your district rt
apparently the median stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer life expectancy is only about eight
months it's good to know huh
[Music] every one of these kids was donated by a school child
it was the kids that collected and donated every one of the 1.8 million pennies that paid for the project
and the grown-ups they just throw that stuff away
now wait wait a minute wait a minute so what you're telling me is that you didn't do it and perez is setting you up
i know that you've been a runner for drug dealers for at least two years listen como you have to let me help you
as much as you're going to help me
that's good now just shade it in what are we going to do about gamma
make some black magic i don't know i just keep thinking what if perez magically dropped dad
like what if a car ran into him like grandma and what if he accidentally shot himself
you really thinking or just daydreaming i'm just praying
for now mr parson is going to help yeah and i mean that's good for como but
i mean destiny and abel mean well but to get that 5k i have to do it on my own
if anyone's going to make something happen it's gonna be me okay so show me what happened at the
da's office
perez is fully capable of setting them up that doesn't mean green doesn't have it coming the kid's been on the street all his
life doesn't make him guilty i mean you don't think he's dirty he's been a runner for drug dealers for at least two
years i mean you already know that what's your friend judge carter going to say about this just carter doesn't own
me well maybe he owns como green isn't he the one who let him off the hook in the first place
look i made my reputation on going after corruption no matter where it leads i'm guessing you picked your target's
ouster but be careful how you pick your battles judge carter has always been in your house he's been pushing you
financing you mentoring you or is he just trying to own me are you looking a gift horse in the
mouth maybe more like taking a clue straight from the mouth of course
what's with the horse that's a very special pony brianna
that's the horse that paid for this shop you bet on horse races
gambling's for fools but sometimes you have to make a choice
let me see your penny did you know that if you flip this coin
forever evidently it will come up heads for 40 years in a row
not likely absolutely likely you just have to do it long enough just
imagine if you were born during that streak you would think that when you flip a penny it would always come up heads
that what kind of spoil would your pennywork though i'd be going in a circle that's what we
do we think that our experience in life is the only one there is but reality is so much better
your choices are infinite so what did you choose that time
i chose to go for it
so
abel says gabriel is a good-hearted and talented artist he doesn't want to be part of the gangs
but he can't seem to find a way out i know that feeling and he sees all these kids around him
dying but nobody seems to notice that that's true
so he starts drawing these chalk outlines of their bodies in the streets every time someone dies
who's gonna notice that it took a while but people started to notice able says we need to notice the good stuff just as
much as the bad stuff you really want to do this don't you
well somebody should all right take these down to the bank and ask them
to split it 25 in each bag they're not gonna like you for asking so you're going to bat your eyes at them right
okay
mom told you well it makes you think doesn't
no i do understand you listen you need to stay put
you hear me babe you need to stay put don't you go anywhere
yeah i love you too
kids man wow perez actually loves somebody
i just need to bust some butt man
i got a strange call from como last night como
como's in jail why is he calling you i gave him my number a while back
just in case he says that girlfriend of his
she has something on judge carter let's say fbi on your badge
what's that got to do with us you think carter's running drugs or something
what part of narcotics don't you understand what part don't you understand
just need to do your job and what is our job our job is drugs on the street
keep your nose clean kid anything other than that it's just messy
[Music]
god protect the innocent for they might surely be
[Applause] trembled by the horns of those who are
trying to be free [Applause] wasted on the pillow
where the tears of those is shamed
god protects the innocent until they
rise again it's everywhere
a girl in a mask someone taste the bitter root that comes
to those alone [Applause] wrapped up in their only eyes getting
drunk or getting strong
waiting for some reason [Music] that maybe you
can give hard to find some truth to make them
want to live reaching out for better life
it's easy just to say someday i'll repay the ones who helped
[Music] if they're not there to take it
loyal gives you those in need [Music]
they can give to someone else that's how
[Music]
just don't forget the people they might
need you soon it takes some time for seed to grow and
flowers
help protect the innocent and somehow in their need
[Music] you can multiply with us
penny [Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
[Music] well i can tell you aren't getting any
brighter he said lay off what about me do you even care how this affects my
life no of course not you can stuff your little goody two-shoes attitude up your behind as far
as i'm concerned look it's not all about you
all right sometimes we have to choose what's right and you're always right
okay
hey time to visit i see
talk some sense into him he's an idiot
i just got another call and you're not gonna like it yeah what's up
we got 15 minutes to get down to
[Music]
right so the parking lot
are you sure about this perez you got a choice
whether you choose to do something or choose to do nothing you're going to impact thousands
what makes you think anything i do matters you make a difference whether you want to or not
question is [Music]
so [Music]
after all these years i'm still
i here imagine why
today sam robin's efforts have paid off as the opening ribbon was cut on the
newly named helena kemp park this fair hill based renovation project
brought together civic and community leaders in celebration of things that
make a tangible positive difference in our drug-torn neighborhoods
it's the small things that make the biggest difference each day helena kemp tried to do five small things to make
something better but the biggest impact that we can have is a simple kind word when someone needs
that the most and we can all do that thanks so much destiny and back to you
at the desk
so we got a choice you choose
i choose we stick together
[Music] hmm
still doing the good stuff somebody has to if you don't
who will maybe we can do something together
i'd like that [Music]
what's next i don't know what would you choose
so
how are you hey how are you is that it
we're not dealing with you right now give it to me right now give it to me right now how this works sir wait in the background where is my mouth give me my
money else give me you need to calm down do not move give me my match right now sir relax what is mine i don't need to
do this i want right now i don't need to do this give me
you know me you made me the person i am i'm your product
the hand i was dealt was the hand i was dealt but i had to make a choice
and you're gonna sit there and judge my choices
[Music]
[Music] god protect the
innocent for they might surely be
trampled by the hearts of those who are trying to be
free wasted on a pillow
are the tears of those ashamed
god protect the innocents until they
rise again [Music]
someone tastes the bitter root that comes to
those alone wrapped up in their only eyes getting
drunk getting stoned [Music]
waiting for some reason that maybe you could give
trying hard to find some truth to make them
want to live reaching out for a better life
it's easy just to say someday i'll repay the ones who helped
along the way if they're not there
[Music]
they can give to someone else that's how i'll
[Music]
just don't forget [Music]
it's time to blow [Music] help protect the innocent
and somehow in their need
you can multiply your love [Music]
and love the life you lead
