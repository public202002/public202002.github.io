This is a wrong explanation.
The spontaneous orderly arrangement in the example is due to the effect of gravity. Dice can lower their overall center of gravity when arranged neatly, and the same is true for nails. If gravity is removed, such as by astronauts conducting experiments in the space station, you will see that neither the dice nor the nails will spontaneously organize neatly.

Does entropy also explain why elementary school students never line up in a straight line?

I'm a physics student, and to my limited knowledge, the entropy of the dice did decrease.
But the process still happened because of the release of potential energy when a die falls.

The spontaneity may be determined by the change in the Gibbs free energy, which is given by dG = dQ - TdS (assuming isothermal and isobaric process). If dG < 0, the process is spontaneous.
This is because the increase of entropy of the surrounding (-dQ/T) compensates for the decrease of entropy of the system (dS), thus abiding by the second law of thermodynamics.

In this particular case presented in the video, since the system is not isolated (meaning, work and heat can trespass the boundary of the system), the decrease of entropy of the dice is compensated by the increase of entropy of surrounding caused by the release of heat that generated by the falling of the dice.

I genuinely enjoy every video of yours! Thanks for uploading such an amazing video :)

I think if whoever the first person to use the word "disordered" to dscribe entropy had instead used "homogenous" or something I think we'd be like 50 years ahead with our understanding of physics and information theory

Another thing to consider
The dice and nails also reached a state where the gravitational potential energy of the system was minimized, the disordered arrangement took up more volume meaning there were lower states the dice could be in if organized.

The gravitational potential energy was thus, dissipated as sound and heat.

This is equivalent to the nature of living systems.  They exist in what we would call a more ordered state, but their capacity for converting useful forms of energy to waste heat more than offsets any apparent decrease in any other aspect of entropy they cause.

'Amount of free volume per dice increases'. I thought that the amount of free volume is the same before and after aligning dice in a finite system, it is just that the same 'old' free volume is now concentrated in 'new' free volume in space continuously, above the dice, not scattered between dice.

Wait a minute...
Entropy increases in an "isolated" system, but the dice in the jar cannot be considered isolated if you apply force to shake them, right? The whole system is the jar + your hands (or your drill), am I right?
If so, are we sure that the entropy of the dice hasn't decreased if that of the whole system, including the drill, has increased?
As with your A.C. where the entropy of the fresh air has decreased but the overall entropy of the fresh + hot air has actually increased?
Or as in a living organism, a commonly accepted definition of which is a "local entropy reduction", yet implying a clear increase in the entropy of both the organism and its environment?

Excellent video, but I think you have it wrong with regard to the dice and nails.  They settle when jostled into the lowest energy state - that being the lowest overall point in the gravitational field they are in.  Do the same thing in a location without gravity and you'll get different results.

I agree with the rubber band example however.  Note that stretching a rubber band heats up the rubber, and it cools again when it contracts.  This is consistent with entropy.  The nails and dice would also heat up (or increase in average speed) if you jostled them in zero gravity just like the rubber by the amount of energy expended to jostle/stretch.

Entropy is simply a measure of how likely a configuration is.  Sure, it's possible that rubber band could stretch itself just sitting on my desk, but with 100's of billions of molecules in it all needing to do essentially the same thing at the same time over a long period of time (contextually speaking) a mathematician would call it a statistical impossibility.

Gotta disagree with the reasoning that there is more entropy in the ordered dice because they are more compact and "have more room to move around." They only have more room compared to the height of the disordered state. The dice are not actually concerned about the height of the disordered state, so I would argue that they are in fact at lower entropy since the room they care about (to the sides and below them due to gravity), is less, and there are fewer opportunities for the dice to move around.

The trick here is not to compare the original disordered dice configuration to the final ordered one, but rather to imagine the distribution of dice orientations while the container is being shaken. At equilibrium, most of the dice align and the ones near the top are constantly and rapidly bouncing around. 

If the container is not being shaken, the entropy of both configurations near zero because the dice have almost no probability of changing state. And analyzing the situation becomes harder because the disordered configuration will have a higher energy level due to potential energy than the ordered configuration

2:35 sounds fishy...  please check:
1. microstates in the Bolzmann formula have the same energy. Here, if any dice goes to the free space above, the system will have its energy increased by the work against gravity. This breaks the condition of the microcanonical ensemble
2. Microstates are equally possible, however we don't see dices jump into the free space by their own will, therefore the shown state has much larger probability to be in and this breaks the condition of the microcanonical ensemble

To my understanding entropy describes particles "desire" to reduce their energy to reach the most stable state. The dice prefer the tightly packed state because here they have the lowest amount of potential energy. Also it takes a lot more energy to break that state apart, because the previous unorganized state could be broken apart by the tapping / rotating, the new state however is hardly affected by it.

Reminds me of how the initial state of the early universe would have appeared about as random/disordered as possible yet gravitationally speaking was very low entropy.

entropy is not disorder for example this Beaker of dice has less entropy than this Beaker of dice and this box of nails has less entropy than this box of nails let me show you why this is by first starting with a bunch of disorganized dice in a jar normally to get stuff to pack down better you have to tap it tapping works great for spheres but not for cubes for cubes you have to twist them if you suddenly start and stop the jar the sheer force from the jar allows the dice to rotate until their flat surface is facing down over
00:32

many starts and stops a pattern emerges amazingly from this seemingly random jiggling of the dice they all line up in nicely stacked rows and columns perfectly fitting into the most packed way they could fit into this jar this will actually happen with any solid particle of any regular shape if I take a box of nails for example and Shake it for a while eventually they all align shake a bunch of hard Spears and they'll organize into a face centered cubic pattern all hard particles will tend to spontaneously organize
01:06

themselves it seems like there's some Force making these shapes align in a certain way but why well it's because of something called directional entropic forces it's when entropy itself acts like a force these cubes and nails are going from a low entropy state of looking all disorganized to a higher entropy state of looking organized now if you thought that entropy was disorder you aren't alone if you ask most people which jar has less entropy they'll probably tell you that the one that's nicely ordered has
01:36

less entropy in fact let's check chat GPT which can represent most people I guess so I'll ask it if I have a jar that has a bunch of randomly oriented Dice and a jar that has a bunch of dice nicely stacked in rows and columns which one has more entropy the jar with the randomly oriented dice has more entropy compared to the jar with dice stacked in rows and columns the lack of order and the high degree of Random mean the system is highly disordered which corresponds to high entropy at first thought this seems right indeed
02:07

chat GPT is a little bit right the orientational entropy of the system decreases but this loss in entropy is way more than offset by a huge increase in translational entropy of the system what I mean by this is that when the dice are disordered they take up this amount of volume but once the dice are ordered and you look at the same volume you can see that there's this new amount of free volume that opens up this makes it so that the amount of free volume per D increases so if we wanted we have all this space above for any Dy to move
02:42

anywhere it wants and when we increase the number of places that a Dy can be it means that we've given the whole system more possible states that it could be in and entropy is defined as the number of possible states of a system so the entropy increases so any solid shape has a tendency to maximize face to-face alignment this creates more free volume and that means that overall the entropy is greater in an ordered versus a disordered box of shapes of the same volume so in this case entropy acted like this unseen Force pulling the dice
03:14

together to fit into this tightly packed pattern as close as possible this mysterious force is called the entropic force it's an emergent force that happens from the statistical tendency for every system to increase in entropy over time this entrop I force feels and acts like a true force in fact when I stretch out this rubber band the reason it Springs back isn't due to any elastic Force pulling it back it's just due to the entropic force let me show you what I mean if I just take a single molecule
03:46

of atoms strung out in a line like this there are no other forces acting on them other than the fact that they're connected to each other and they're jiggling around like atoms do they're free to move and fold in any direction but if I disconnect this and here look what happens to the string of atoms they shoot to the other side and curl up there isn't some Force that's making them coil together like this it's just that statistically there are more ways to be in a coiled State than a straight
04:14

state if we wait long enough sometimes randomly it'll pop out straight again for a split second but overall there's overwhelmingly more ways to be in a coiled State than in a straight State and since everything always tends to move towards the state that has more possible configurations the string of atoms coil together even if I pull it and stretch it out again it Springs back like a rubber band in fact I have to exert a force to even get it straight again the relationship between this force and the entropy of the molecule is
04:46

given by this equation here Force equals temperature times the change in entropy divided by the change in distance or length that we stretched it out so this emergent Force happens purely from the fact that entropy increases over time this is the same thing that's happening in a rubber band there are these long polymer molecules that are coiled right now but when I pull on the rubber band it straightens them it takes Force to do this and if I let it go it Springs back purely from the entropic force in fact
05:15

anytime you have the movement of matter with increasing entropy then there's this entropic Force so don't be tempted to call entropy disorder think of it more as a tendency to move towards more possible configurations or States before we continue if you like learning from my channel then you'll love mellan TV mellan TV provides the best documentaries ad free I really like the space genre on here where I just watched an awesome documentary about Venus but there are so many cool genres that you'll love as well mellan TV's motto is

06:18

is because when forming the crystal heat was released so overall the entropy still increased so if ever there are little pockets of decreased entropy like when I air condition my garage that means that somewhere else like outside of my garage I'm increasing the entropy this tendency for entropy to increase is universal in fact it's so Universal that we call it a law the law is that the entropy of the universe is always increasing with time we call it the second law of Thermodynamics what's amazing is that this is a law simply
06:51

because of a statistical effect when enough chaotic and random events happen eventually it leads to very predictable events like when I pull an elastic band I know it's going to spring back ow [Music] [Music]
