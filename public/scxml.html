This state machine, called "Eventisimo," helps manage the flow of events in a system. It has several states and transitions between them. The initial state is "IDLE," which means the system is waiting for an event called "MD" to occur. When this event happens, the system transitions to the "DDReady" state. In the "DDReady" state, two events can occur: "MM" and "MU." If "MM" happens, the system moves to the "DDTest" state. If "MU" happens, the system goes back to the "IDLE" state. In the "DDTest" state, the system checks if a minimum move is required. If a "wait" event occurs, the system stays in the "DDTest" state. If a "yes" event happens, the system transitions to the "DM" state. In the "DM" state, the system performs a move. If a "MM" event occurs, the system stays in the "DM" state. If a "MU" event happens, the system transitions to the "DD" state. In the "DD" state, the system performs a drop action and always transitions back to the "IDLE" state. This state machine helps manage the flow of events and actions in a system, ensuring that each step is followed in a specific order.
